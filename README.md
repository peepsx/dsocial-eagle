# Arisen Air Drop dApp
This is the code for Arisen's air drop system, launching on February 19th, 2020 via [air.arisen.network](https://air.arisen.network). Development of this system has been sponsored by @peeps.

## Features
Arisen's air drop system has been originally designed to help give away RSN coins to 1 million users around the world.
It can easily be used for giving away other digital assets on the Arisen network as well, where the token creator is able to grow their social following at the very same time, while also onboarding more users to the Arisen network.

Below are some of the features and integrations included within the air drop dApp:
